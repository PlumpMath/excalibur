Character:
I WANT: 
To be king of the pirates
To map the entire world
To become the best swordfighter
To save my hometown
To rescue my family
To be free

love of money
love of danger
escape the law
fight the law
indulge desire for violence
nowhere else to go
born a pirate and knows nothing else
in love with the idea of piracy
has a family to feed
getting away from their family
likes travel

THE STATUS QUO:

THE LIE:



Conflicts:
Fear, the haunted place
Sailing through the storm
The shipwreck
(getting the gang back together)
recruiting a new crewmember
turning an enemy to our side
chase scene
sea battle
ship-to-ship brawl

Conflicts can be:
Character vs. Character
Ship vs. Ship
Crew vs. Crew
Ship vs. Sea
Ship vs. Storm
Crew/Ship vs. Shipwreck
Crew/Ship vs. Weighing Anchor
Crew/Ship vs. Getting ready to set sail
Crew/Ship vs. Provisioning the ship

A crew is a collection of characters working together
A ship has a crew




The secret island fortress has its own plots:
- finding it in the first place (shipwrecked there, gifted it by former inhabitant, treasure map)
- making the port secure
- located by enemies, defending it
- 

The sea of troubles:
- rumors and legends ahead of time
- forshadowing
- near miss as they avoid being driven into it
- they use it to trap an enemy ship against it
- they have to go through it
- the passage through
- they're victorious / they were shipwrecked inside -> leads to new discovery

The port called home:
- the hometown they can never go back to permanently, but must occasionally visit

The antagonist's fortress
The antagonist's ship

Mutiny

Finding buried treasure
- rumors of the treasure
- acquire a map/clue
- searching for the destination

Travel (getting from point a to point b is a common subplot)
-Can we get there by walking (is it on the same island?)
-Do we have a ship to sail there in? (if not: get ship or get passage)
-If we have a ship, get it ready to set sail
-Set sail

=== Weighing Anchor ===

# clear the deck, make ready
"The crew #adjectively# cleared the capstan and made ready to weigh anchor."
"The order was given, and soon the messenger was run out and the capstan manned."
# capstan bars fitted to capstan
"{crewmember} fitted the bars, and the #sailors# took their positions around the capstan."
"{crewmember} took the bars from where they were stowed, and the #sailors# fitted them to the capstan."
"\"Take your positions, you #sailors#,\" said {the boatswain}."
"There came soon the familiar racket of making sail and trimming yards and the clank of the capstan pawls. "
"The capstan bars were now fully manned."
#pulling at the capstan
"The #sailors# pressed their broad chests against the powerful levers, planted their feet firmly upon the deck, straightened out their backs, and slowly pawl after pawl was gained.
""That's your sort, my hearties," exclaimed {the boatswain} encouragingly, as {the boatswain} applied {the boatswain's} tremendous strength to the outer extremity of one of the bars, "heave with a will! heave, and she _must_ come! _heave_, all of us!! now--one--_two_--three!!!"
"The #sailors# strained at the bars, the pawl clicking as they drove the capstan round.
"The chorus of the shanty kept time with the clicks of the pawl.
#sing a shanty
["As the #sailors# turned the capstan, {the boatswain} took up the verse and the crew repeated the chorus: {SHANTY}", "The crew sang in time with their work: {SHANTY}", "As was their practice, they sang to maintain the rhythm. {SHANTY}"]

=== The Sea

{PAR}Much has been said of the sunrise at sea; but it will not compare with the sunrise on shore. It lacks the accompaniments of the songs of birds, the awakening hum of humanity, and the glancing of the first beams upon trees, hills, spires, and house-tops, to give it life and spirit. There is no scenery. But, although the actual rise of the sun at sea is not so beautiful, yet nothing will compare for melancholy and dreariness with the early breaking of day upon \"Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste.\"

{PAR}There is something in the first gray streaks stretching along the eastern horizon and throwing an indistinct light upon the face of the deep, which combines with the boundlessness and unknown depth of the sea around, and gives one a feeling of loneliness, of dread, and of melancholy foreboding, which nothing else in nature can. This gradually passes away as the light grows brighter, and when the sun comes up, the ordinary monotonous sea day begins.






The next day broke bright and clear; both wind and cloud had fled; the sea had gone down, and the vessel was under easy sail. A flock of gulls were circling in the morning air, screaming with delight as they picked the crumbs that floated astern; and all went merrily oh!

=== Cats 

No one in the ship had the slightest idea how Tom came on board, or who brought him, or where he came from. He made his first appearance in public while, outward bound, we were crossing the Bay of Biscay—that strange mysterious sea, beneath whose waves the bones of so many of our bravest countrymen lie bleaching. It was a roughish night, squally rather, without much sea on, but the wind changing its mind every minute, whisking into foam the crests of the inky waves, and carrying the spray far into the rigging. It was a night to try the sea-legs of any one, so jerky and uncertain was the vessel’s motion; and the oldest sailors staggered like drunken men, and were fain to cling to rigging or shrouds. I was smoking on the quarter-deck just before turning in,—it had gone six bells[13] in the first watch, and[Pg 441] everything was snug for the night, when something black as Erebus whisked past me, visible but for a moment in the binnacle’s light, and disappeared in the darkness forward. I looked inquiringly at the man at the wheel, a serious old seamen, who, in answer to my mute appeal, turned his quid twice in his mouth and, addressing the compass, “That’s the devil, sir,” said he, “begging your pardon, sir. Came on board to-night when we close-reefed topsails durin’ a squall.”
