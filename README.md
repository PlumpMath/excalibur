NaNoGenMo 2016 Novel Generator

For NaNoGenMo 2016, I had some expansive goals. What you see before you is the result.

You can read a finished novel generated by the system here:

Or read some notes about it's development here: https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/6

Contains a lot of text from various Project Gutenberg books, especially from 
works by Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, and Richard Henry Dana, Jr. Though 
there is surprisingly very little from _Moby Dick_.

Installing
----------

I developed this with Anaconda 4.1.1 on Windows, and havenâ€™t extensively tested
it elsewhere.

You should, theoretically, be able to run it with

````
pip install -r requirements.txt
python excalibur.py
````

### About the name

Note: It's called "Excalibur" because that was the first word I thought of that
started with the same sound as "Expansion".
