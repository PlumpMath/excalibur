Excalibur
=========

NaNoGenMo 2016 Novel Generator


Installing
----------

I developed this with Anaconda 4.1.1 on Windows, and havenâ€™t extensively tested
it elsewhere.

You should, theoretically, be able to run it with

````
pip install -r requirements.txt
python excalibur.py
````

### About the name

Note: It's called "Excalibur" because that was the first word I thought of that
started with the same sound as "Expansion".
